# MySQL_Final_Project
Project Title: Library Management System (MySQL)

Description:
This project implements a relational database schema for a Library Management System. 
It manages authors, books, members, staff, loans, and fines, supporting typical library operations such as lending books, tracking overdue loans, and managing fines.

How to Run/Setup:
1. Open your MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or command line).
2. Import the `Final_project.sql` file:
   - In MySQL Workbench: File > Open SQL Script > select this file, then click "Run".
   - In command line: 
     mysql -u your_username -p < /path/to/Final_project.sql
3. The script will create the `LibraryDB` database, tables, sample data, and indexes.

4. You can then run the sample queries provided at the end of the script to test the functionality.
5. Modify the sample data and queries as needed to fit your specific use case.
6. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create databases and tables in your MySQL server.
7. For any issues, check the MySQL error log for details.
